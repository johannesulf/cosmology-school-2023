Detailed program information is forthcoming.

We will be providing morning and afternoon coffee/snacks during breaks. Lunch and dinner will *not* be catered, but there are many good and varied restaurants on Central Campus. We may organize a School dinner midway through the week. Finally, we will definitely organize an outdoor activity, possibly canoeing on Gallup Pond (pending decent weather).
