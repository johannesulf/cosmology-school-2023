Detailed program information is enclosed below. You can also subscribe to the [calendar with events](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_309c07f23260af54e51cf9252b01a3793dd9d53a86601722d36605ef272db88b%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York). We will be providing morning and afternoon coffee/snacks during breaks. Lunch and dinner will *not* be catered, but there are many good and varied restaurants on Central Campus; we are providing a [doc with local recommendations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m9LPu9BdRdXluJlyFg-gHIzmNICdsXhO/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107916546578111437896&rtpof=true&sd=true). Finally, we are organizing an outdoor trip - canoeing on Argo Pond. The Pond is walking distance to CCCB (30 mins max); lunch will be catered and made available there, prior to canoeing.
