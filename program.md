Detailed program information is forthcoming.

We will be providing morning and afternoon coffee/snack breaks. Lunch and dinner will *not* be catered, but there are many interesting restaurants on Central Campus. We will organize a School dinner midway through the week. Finally, we will have organize an outdoor activity, possibly canoeing on Gallup Pond (pending decent weather).
