We adopt the [APS code of conduct](https://www.aps.org/meetings/policies/code-conduct.cfm). It states in part that "Participants will treat each other with respect and consideration to create a collegial, inclusive, and professional environment. Creating a supportive environment to enable scientific discourse at APS meetings is the responsibility of all participants. Participants will avoid any inappropriate actions or statements based on individual characteristics such as age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, marital status, nationality, political affiliation, ability status, educational background, or any other characteristic protected by law. Disruptive or harassing behavior of any kind will not be tolerated."

The code of conduct pertains to the in-persion portion of the meeting as well as discussions and interactions on Zoom and Slack.
