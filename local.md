**VENUE:** The School will take place on University of Michigan's Central Campus in Ann Arbor, MI. The exact location of the daily sessions is still TBD; the auditorium where we meet will be either in the [West Hall](https://maps.studentlife.umich.edu/building/west-hall) (where the Physics Department resides), or else in the brand new [Central Campus Classroom Building](https://cccb.provost.umich.edu/), or maybe in both. We will enable the meeting for hybrid attendance, and there will be a dedicated Zoom link for remote participants to dial into talks.

**LODGING:** Most of you will likely want to use services Airbnb or Hotels.com which offer numerous options on campus. One good option that we noticed is are [Exhibit A2 apartments](https://exhibita2.com/) which look nice, can be shared by ~3 students at a reasonable cost, and are very nearby the School venue. The fancy hotels that are very near Central Campus such as [Bell Tower](https://belltowerhotel.com/), [Michigan League](https://inn.studentlife.umich.edu/rooms/), or [Ross Executive Learning Conference Center](https://www.acc-elandconferencecenter.com/rooms) tend to be pricey (ballpark $200/night) but, if you can afford them, are a great option. 

**LOCAL INFO:** You can find lots of information on the [LCTP visitor info site](https://lsa.umich.edu/lctp/visitor-information.html). Probably the most important thing to know is that the closest airport is the Detroit Metro Airport (DTW), which is 30-40 mins away by taxi/Uber and has good flight connections worldwide. An Uber ride from the airport costs $50-60; there are also buses which are cheaper.
