LODGING: We will book a block of rooms in a dormitory on campus. The price for double-occupancy rooms will be about $40 per person per night. Many of you will likely want to use services Airbnb or Hotels.com which offer numerous options on campus. Fancy hotels that are very near Central Campus such as Bell Tower or the Graduate tend to be pricey (ballpark $200/night).
