**VENUE:** The School will take place on University of Michigan's Central Campus in Ann Arbor, MI. The lectures will take place in the brand new [Central Campus Classroom Building](https://cccb.provost.umich.edu/). We will enable the meeting for hybrid attendance, and there will be a dedicated Zoom link for remote participants to dial into talks. The map of central campus, with CCCB clearly labeled, is [HERE](/assets/images/campus_map.png).

**LODGING:** Most of you will likely want to use services Airbnb or Hotels.com which offer numerous options on campus. One good option that we noticed is are [Exhibit A2 apartments](https://exhibita2.com/) which look nice, can be shared by ~3 students at a reasonable cost, and are very nearby the School venue. The fancy hotels that are very near Central Campus such as [Bell Tower](https://belltowerhotel.com/), [Michigan League](https://inn.studentlife.umich.edu/rooms/), or [Ross Executive Learning Conference Center](https://www.acc-elandconferencecenter.com/rooms) tend to be pricey (ballpark $200/night) but, if you can afford them, are a great option. 

**TRAVEL:** You can find lots of information on the [LCTP visitor info site](https://lsa.umich.edu/lctp/visitor-information.html). Probably the most important thing to know is that the closest airport is the Detroit Metro Airport (DTW), which is 30-40 mins away by taxi/Uber and has good flight connections worldwide. An Uber ride from the airport costs $50-60; there are also buses which are cheaper. A taxi should cost $70 or so, and if you want to travel in style, a [Metrocar](https://metropolitanairportcars.com/) (with a uniformed driver) should cost slightly more, in the $85 ballpark.

**WHERE TO EAT/DRINK IN ANN ARBOR:** Our students and postdocs have created [this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m9LPu9BdRdXluJlyFg-gHIzmNICdsXhO/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=107916546578111437896&rtpof=true&sd=true) for more information on where to eat, drink, have coffee, or what to do in Ann Arbor.
